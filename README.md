# surfs_up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
For this project, I analyzed weather trends (specifically temperature) trends before opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. This is important to do because both of these services are weather-dependent. 

## Results

### Three key differences between June and December

## Summary 
Two additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December 
(do precipitation because that will impact surf shop)
