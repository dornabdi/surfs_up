# surfs_up

## Overview of Project
For this project, I analyzed weather trends (specifically temperature) trends before opening a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu. This is important to do because both of these services are weather-dependent. 

### Purpose


## Results

### Deliverable 1: Eligible Retirees
- Three key differences between June and December

## Summary 
Two additional queries to gather more weather data for June and December 
(do precipitation because that will impact surf shop)
